## Cloud Native Design
### Object Storage
1. Unlimited Storage Capacity
2. Affordable via EC
3. SLA(Scalable + Availability + Reliability)

### Storage Advancements in NVMe SSD
1. Millions of IOPS
2. Thread-Per-Core(Run-to-Complete) architecture shifts bottleneck of IO-intensive workload from IO to CPU.
3. Scale with CPU processors
   Glommio, SPDK, io-uring, [Seastar](http://seastar.io/)

## Separation of Concern

#### Separation of Storage and Compute
Scale Independently

#### Separation of CP and AP
CP = Consistency + Partition
AP = Availability + Partition

Strong consistency while RTO tends to be zero
RPO = 0 and RTO -> 0
