# Shutdown Procedure

Data node register handlers for `SIGTERM` and `SIGHUP` using `ctrlc` crate. Once shutdown signal is caught, it broadcasts the shutdown attempt to all `Node`s.

On receiving shutdown signal, `Node` will NOT accept new TCP connections and send `GOAWAY` frame to each existing connections. Data node assumes that front-end clients will complete their sessions at their earliest convenient time and close connections thereafter.

Once all connections are closed, data node would drop IO-task channel, triggering shutdown procedure of IO module. Once all IO tasks are served, notify indexer to flush memtable.
