# Streaming Batch Protocol(SBP) v0.1

## Overview

The Streaming Batch Protocol (SBP) is a frame base protocol. All frames begin with a fixed 12-octet header, followed by an extended header and payload. Below graph shows the layout of a frame.

[![Frame Layout](images/sbp_layout.png)](images/sbp_layout.png)

The protocol is big-endian (network byte order).

Each frame contains a fixed-size header followed by a variable-size extended header and payload. The header is described in Section 2. The content of the extended header and payload depends on the header operation code. The list of supported operation codes and the details of the payload are described in Section 4. The frame's payload is opaque to the SBP frame format and is interpreted by the application layer.

The design of SBP follows two principles:
- Batch: SBP is designed to support batch processing, which means that the client can send multiple requests in one frame, and vice versa. This is useful for reducing the overhead of network communication.
- Streaming: The server does not need to respond to all the requests in a single batch, which means that the server could respond to the requests in a streaming way to reduce the latency of the response.

## Frame Header
The Frame Header is a fixed 12-octet header that appears at the beginning of every frame. It contains fields for the Frame Length, Magic Code, Operation Code, Flags, and Stream Identifier.

### Frame Length
The length of the frame is expressed as a 32-bit integer. `Frame Length` = 16 + `Header.length` + `Payload.length`.
### Magic Code
A fixed value representing the protocol self. Currently, the value is 23. This field is used to detect the presence of the SBP protocol, and implementations MUST discard any frame that does not contain the correct magic number.
### Operation Code
The 16-bit opcode of the frame. The frame opcode determines the format and semantics of the frame. Implementations MUST ignore and discard any frame with an unknown opcode.
### Flags
Flags apply to this frame. The flags have the following meaning (described by the mask that allows selecting them):
- 0x01: Response flag. If set, the frame contains the response payload to a specific request frame identified by a stream identifier. If not set, the frame represents a request frame.
- 0x02: Response end flag. If set, the frame is the last frame in a response sequence. If not set, the response sequence continues with more frames. The response sequence may contain one or more frames.
- 0x04: System error flag. If a response frame has the this flag set, its extended header will be type of `SystemErrorResponse`.

The rest of the flags are currently unused and ignored.
### Stream Identifier
A unique identifier for a request frame or a stream request frame. That is, it is used to support request-response or streaming communication models simultaneously. The stream identifier is expressed as a 32-bit integer in network byte order.

When communicating with the server, the client must set this stream id to a non-negative value. It is ensured that the request and response frames will have matching stream ids.
### Extended Header
The extended header starts with format and length fields. The format field is used to identify the serialization format of the extended header. The length field is used to determine the length of the extended header. The length field is expressed as a 24-bit integer in network byte order. The extended header is followed by the payload.

Currently, SBP only defines one format type:
- 0x01: FlatBuffers format indicates that the payload of the extended header is serialized by flatbuffers.

## Frame Definitions
This specification outlines various types of frames, each with a unique 16-bit opcode to identify them. Each frame type has its own specific extended header and payload.

The table below shows all the supported frame types along with a preallocated opcode.

| Opcode | Frame Type | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| 0x0001 | PING | Measure a minimal round-trip time from the sender. |
| 0x0002 | GOAWAY | Initiate a shutdown of a connection or signal serious error conditions. |
| 0x0003 | HEARTBEAT | To keep clients alive through periodic heartbeat frames. |
| 0x0004 | ALLOCATE_ID | Allocate a unique identifier from placement managers. |
| 0x1001 | APPEND | Append records to the data node. |
| 0x1002 | FETCH | Fetch records from the data node. |
| 0x2001 | LIST_RANGES | List ranges from the PM of a batch of streams. |
| 0x2002 | SEAL_RANGES | Request seal ranges of a batch of streams. The PM will provide the `SEAL_AND_NEW` semantic while Data Node only provide the `SEAL` semantic. |
| 0x2003 | SYNC_RANGES | Syncs newly writable ranges to a data node to accelerate the availability of a newly created writable range. |
| 0x2004 | DESCRIBE_RANGES | Describe the details of a batch of ranges, mainly used to get the max offset of the current writable range. |
| 0x3001 | CREATE_STREAMS | Create a batch of streams. |
| 0x3002 | DELETE_STREAMS | Delete a batch of streams. |
| 0x3003 | UPDATE_STREAMS | Update a batch of streams. |
| 0x3004 | DESCRIBE_STREAMS | Fetch the details of a batch of streams. |
| 0x3005 | TRIM_STREAMS | Trim the min offset of a batch of streams. |
| 0x4001 | REPORT_METRICS | Data node reports metrics to the PM. |

The below sub-sections describe the details of each frame type, including their usage, their binary format, and the meaning of their fields.

### PING
The PING frame (opcode=0x0001) is a mechanism for measuring a minimal round-trip time from the sender, as well as determining whether an idle connection is still functional. PING frames can be sent from any endpoint.

Receivers of a PING frame set the response flag and the response end flag to do a PONG, with the same extended headers and payload.

### GOAWAY
The GOAWAY frame (opcode=0x0002) is used to initiate the shutdown of a connection or to signal serious error conditions. GOAWAY allows an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new streams while still finishing the processing of previously established streams. This enables administrative actions, like server maintenance.

### HEARTBEAT
The HEARTBEAT frame(opcode=0x0003) is used to keep clients alive, carrying the necessary role and status information.

The client can send a heartbeat frame to the server periodically. If the server does not receive any heartbeat frame from the client for a long time, the server may close the connection, even clean up the resources of the client.

**Request Frame:**

```
Request Header => client_id client_role data_node
  client_id => string

Only the stream_id is required in the request frame, the other fields are ignored.

The frame is simple, so the detailed description is omitted.

**Response Frame:**
```
Response Header => throttle_time_ms [delete_responses]
  throttle_time_ms => int32
  status => code message detail

Response Header => throttle_time_ms [update_responses]
  throttle_time_ms => int32
  status => code message detail
    code => int16
    message => string
    detail => bytes
  update_responses => updated_stream status
    updated_stream => stream_id replica_nums retention_period_ms
      stream_id => int64
      replica_nums => int8
      retention_period_ms => int64
    status => code message detail
      code => int16
      message => string
      detail => bytes
  
Response Payload => Empty
```

These two frames are similar with the CREATE_STREAMS frame, so the detailed description is omitted.
### DESCRIBE_STREAMS
The DESCRIBE_STREAMS frame(opcode=0x3004) describes a batch of streams from PM. The response frame is similar to the CREATE_STREAMS frame.

**Request Frame:**
```
Request Header => timeout_ms [stream_ids]
  timeout_ms
  stream_ids => stream_id
    stream_id => int64
  
Request Payload => Empty
```

**Response Frame:**
```
Response Header => throttle_time_ms [describe_responses]
  throttle_time_ms => int32
  status => code message detail
    code => int16
    message => string
    detail => bytes
  describe_responses => stream status
    stream => stream_id replica_nums retention_period_ms
      stream_id => int64
      replica_nums => int8
      retention_period_ms => int64
    status => code message detail
      code => int16
      message => string
      detail => bytes
  
Response Payload => Empty
```

### TRIM_STREAMS
The TRIM_STREAMS frame(opcode=0x3005) trims a batch of streams to PM.

The data node stores the records in the stream in a log structure, and the records are appended to the end of the log. Consider the length of disk is limited, the data node will delete the records to recycling the disk space. Once the deletion occurs, some ranges should be trimmed to avoid the clients to read the deleted records. 

The data node will send the TRIM_STREAMS frame to the PM to trim the stream with a trim offset. The PM will delete the ranges whose end offset is less than the trim offset and shrink the ranges whose start offset is less than the trim offset.

**Request Frame:**
```
Request Header => timeout_ms [trimmed_streams]
  timeout_ms
  trimmed_streams => stream_id trim_offset
    stream_id => int64
    trim_offset => int64

## Error Codes

The SBP protocol defines a set of numeric error codes that are used to indicate the type of occurred error. These error codes are used in the status.code field of the response header, and can be translated by the client to a human-readable error message.

### System Error Frame
There is a special error frame that is used to indicate that the server encountered an unexpected error or a request-agnostic error. The error frame is sent with the following format:

```
Error Response Header => status
  status => code message detail
    code => int16
    message => string
    detail => bytes
```

When the system error flag is set, the above error frame is sent instead of the normal response frame.
### Error Codes Table

The error codes are defined in the following table.

| ERROR | CODE | RETRIABLE | DESCRIPTION |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| NONE | 0 | No | No error |
| UNKNOWN | 1 | No | An unexpected server error |
| INVALID_REQUEST | 2 | No | The request is invalid |
| UNSUPPORTED_VERSION | 3 | No | The version of the request is not supported |
| PM_NOT_LEADER | 5 | No | The requested PM node is not the leader. |
