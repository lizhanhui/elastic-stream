//! Data node uses placement clients to talk to placement managers.
//!
//! As a result, placement clients shall comply with `thread-per-core` threading model. Further,
//! placement clients reuse the same `tokio-uring` network library stack to initiate requests and
//! reap completed responses.
//!  
//! For applications that need to talk to `PlacementManager` and `DataNode`, please use crate `front-end-sdk`.
